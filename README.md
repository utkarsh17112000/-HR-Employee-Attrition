# 🟩 Data Analysis Practice: HR Employee Attrition Dataset 👩‍💼📉

As part of my data analytics learning journey, I explored the HR Employee Attrition dataset to gain deeper insights into workforce trends and business decision-making.

🔍 In this project, I focused on:

📊 Identifying key factors influencing attrition

📈 Analyzing trends by department, job role, and age group

📆 Exploring attrition patterns by years at company, job level, and work-life balance

💼 Comparing job satisfaction, overtime, and income brackets with attrition

🧠 Highlighting high-risk groups for churn prediction

💡 Some key questions I aimed to answer: ✔️ Which roles or departments have the highest attrition?
✔️ Does overtime or job satisfaction impact employee turnover?
✔️ Are there patterns based on tenure or income level?

👨‍💻 Tools used:

Microsoft Excel for data exploration and visualization


📁 This dataset offered great opportunities for data cleaning, exploratory analysis, correlation analysis, and storytelling with data — all essential skills in data analytics.
